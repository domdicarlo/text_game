# Text Adventure Game

## About

A text adventure game written in python, still in eaarrrly alpha development. I want to host this game on my Django site eventually, and hope to make major progress on the game this winter break. 

Right now, it is split into two files, inspired and based off of [this example found here](https://blog.trinket.io/python-text-adventure/). The [adventure.py](./adventure.py) file holds all the major infrastructure and the engine of the game. [main.py](./main.py) is the script to run the game, and it loads in a few locations before bringing the game to the termnial.

## To run

While as of 11/15/2019, there is not much to do or see, you can try out the game by typing `python adventure.py` using python3. No external libraries are required. It will not save anything to your disk or anything, the game is entirely contained within the terminal. Type and enter `help` for a list of commands to start going, although you won't be able to advance much at all, just be able to play around with commands.
